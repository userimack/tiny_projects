#  Counting Vowels
# (10 points possible)

# Assume s is a string of lower case characters.

# Write a program that counts up the number of vowels contained in the string s. Valid vowels are: 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u'. For example, if s = 'azcbobobegghakl', your program should print:

# Number of vowels: 5

# For problems such as these, do not include raw_input statements or define the variable s in any way. Our automated testing will provide a value of s for you - so the code you submit in the following box should assume s is already defined. If you are confused by this instruction, please review L4 Problems 10 and 11 before you begin this problem set.


total = 0
for c in s:
    if c == 'a' or c == 'e' or c == 'i' or c == 'o' or c == 'u':
        total += 1
print "Number of vowels: " + str(total)

ALTERNATE SOLUTION
        
num = 0
for letter in s:
  if letter in "aeiou":
    num+=1
print "Number of vowels:" + str(num)
